1. Overview

CmdLauncher is a project aimed at help people launch a command in a graphical
way. CmdLauncher is based on Qt and works on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and
MS-Windows, and maybe FreeBSD, NetBSD.If you are a developer and you have
developed a console program, you could use CmdLauncher to let your program
launch in a graphical way so that people who are not computer experts can also
use it.

2. Install

On UNIX-like systems (including GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, etc.):

First make sure that you have installed cmake, Qt4 and its develop tools. Then
depress the source arhive and switch to the source directory of this project
and use the following commands to compile it:

$ cmake .
$ make

To install it:

# make install

For other platforms (such as Win32), just use cmake to generate the project file and use your
favorate compiler to build it.

3. Usage

To use it, create a file storing the information of your command first, for
example "example.cla". Edit this file with a text editor. The format of this
file could be reffered to sample.cla. Execute "cmdlauncher sample.cla" to see
how it works.
